# QuietConsonant
 UTAU plugin to automatically apply P0 flag to [C C] note type in VCCV formatted UST
 
 The P0 flag disables UTAU's normalization, which makes [C C] connections sound smoother in the context of the rest of the notes.
 
 Uses delta's [UtauPlugin](https://github.com/delta-kimigatame/utauPlugin) Library.

# Usage
 Download latest release and drag the QuietConsonant folder into the UTAU plugins folder

 Please note that the P0 flag does not work with tn_fnds, model4, utaugrowl, or vs4u
